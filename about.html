				<p>Our building used to be the Pipe Organ Company, an historic 100-year-old structure that we have renovated into multi-functional venue site. We inked a deal to purchase the large warehouse space after we had maxed out on our old location for our other business, Core Elite Tumble & Cheer. Sitting on 8 picturesque acres in the middle of Highland, Illinois, our venue is both unique and convenient. Enjoy the beautiful architecture while you celebrate your special moment in one of the most iconic places in town.</p>

        <p>The history of our building dates back to the first decade of the 1900s. The Wicks Organ Co. built the factory and began operating in it in 1910. They manufactured pipe organs for homes in churches across the Midwest. Most of these organs are still in use today! After 107 years in this location, Wicks Organ Co. no longer needed the 88,000 sq. ft. of factory space, as pipe organs are in far less demand. They packed up and moved to a newer, smaller office and factory space that was more in line with their needs. Thus, opened the opportunity for us to step in and rehab and put good use to this massive space!</p>

        <p>The Olde Wicks Factory is owned and operated by a local Highland family. We consider ourselves a small, family business, and love the community of Highland. We are ecstatic to revive this beautiful factory into something usable and loved again. We currently house several female owned and operated businesses that range from a photography studio, make-up studio and a music school, in addition to our own Cheer training facility and the venue spaces.</p>
